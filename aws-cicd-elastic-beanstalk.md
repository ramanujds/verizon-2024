## AWS CI/CD with GitHub and CodePipeline:

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository and Clone it on your Local Machine**
- Create a new repository on GitHub for your Java application.
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

**Step 2: Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment for Running a Java Application**
- Follow the instructions available on AWS documentation or your own notes to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for running a Java application.

**Step 3: (Optional) Build the JAR File and Deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk Environment**
- If needed, build your Java application into a JAR file and deploy it to the Elastic Beanstalk environment. This step can be optional if you prefer to handle the build process in later stages.

**Step 4: Create a buildspec.yml file and Keep it on Your Project's Root Folder**
- Create a `buildspec.yml` file in the root folder of your project. This file will contain the instructions for the build process. You can include commands for compilation, testing, and packaging.

**Step 5: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub**
- Commit and push the changes, including the `buildspec.yml` file, to your GitHub repository.

**Step 6: Browse AWS CodePipeline Service**
- Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodePipeline service.

**Step 7: Create Pipeline (Select New Service Role)**
- Click on "Create Pipeline" and choose a service role for the pipeline to use. If you don't have one, select "New service role" to create a new role with the necessary permissions.

**Step 8: Add Source Provider**
- Configure the source provider as GitHub (Version 1).
- Connect to your GitHub account.
- Select the repository and branch you want to use as the source for your pipeline.

**Step 9: Add Build Stage**
- Configure the build stage using AWS CodeBuild.
- Create a new CodeBuild project and input the required details such as platform, image, VPC, security group, etc.

**Step 10: Add Deploy Stage**
- Configure the deploy stage to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk.
- Select Elastic Beanstalk as the deployment provider.
- Choose the application and environment to deploy the application.
